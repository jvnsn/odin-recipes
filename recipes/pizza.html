        <li>1 can store-bought pizza sauce or marinara sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Homemade Dough:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl or mixer, combine the water, honey , and yeast. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes until yeast starts to form.</li>
        <li>Add salt, flour, and 1 tbsp olive oil. Mix well until the dough pulls away from the bowl.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for 10 minutes, manually.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a bowl. Cover the dough with the remaining olive oil, place back into the bowl, and cover with a damp towel. Place in a warm area and let the dough rise for about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making the pizza:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450Â°F. If you have a pizza pan, lightly oil it with olive oil. Otherwise, you can use a sheet of parchment paper placed on top of the baking pan or cooling rack.</li>
        <li>Flatten the dough and lay it on top of the pizza pan or baking rack with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the softened butter and garlic. Spread it evenly on the pizza dough.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza or marinara sauce evenly on the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle all the cheeses, evenly, except the parmesan.</li>
        <li>Bake for 13 to 15 minutes until the crust is golden brown. Sprinkle with fresh parmesan and parsley.</li>
    </ol>
